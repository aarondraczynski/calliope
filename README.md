Calliope is a barebones, no-frills public transit predictions screen.
It displays bus and train arrival times with big-ass numbers, and that's it.

It is intended for display on an iPad or other tablet of choice, and was
designed to be readable from across the room. Connect Calliope to an
API consumer for your local public transit agency and it will display
the next 3 arrival times in giant 180px font.

San Francisco Muni support is included by default, thanks to [Dan Masquelier](https://github.com/dancrew32).
